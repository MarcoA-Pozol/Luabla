    <p id="p">You might be thinking of the song "Paula" by Zoé. It's a beautiful love song with a dreamy, heartfelt vibe, but it's not one of the most common hits like "Soñé" or "Labios Rotos." The song talks about love in a poetic and emotional way, which fits your description. Would you like to check it out?</p>
